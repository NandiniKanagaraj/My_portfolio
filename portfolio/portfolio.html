    <h2> FETAL HEALTH PREDICTION INTEGRATED WITH
        MONGODB</h2>
    <p>This study aims to classify fetal health using CTG data through various
        machine learning models and data balancing techniques, achieving a notable
        improvement in evaluation metrics by an, average of 2-4 percentage points.
        Additionally, contributed to frontend design.</p>
    
    <h2>EMOTION DETECTION FROM TEXT DATA USING ML
        FRAMEWORK</h2>
    <p>This study uses Kaggle-sourced Twitter data to classify emotions into 6 labels
        using TF-IDF and various ML techniques, achieving a 0.99 F-measure, with
        MLP and tree-based classifiers performing best. This paper was also
        recognized as the Best Paper at the 2024 First International Conference on
        Advances in Modern Age Technologies for Health and Engineering Science
        (AMATHE 2024).</p>
